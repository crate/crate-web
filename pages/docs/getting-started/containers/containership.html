title: Getting started with Crate.IO on ContainerShip

[ContainerShip](http://containership.io/) allows you to configure a hosting stack by combining your own Docker images with their library of software and third party integrations. Effortlessly manage, deploy, and scale across any number of providers. Detach a cluster from our service at any time and use the open source core system on your own.

## Connect Hosting
First, from the _Providers -> Hosting_ menu, connect your hosting accounts. The current options are AWS, Digital Ocean, Joyent, Packet and Rackspace.

## Create Cluster
Next we need to create our cluster, the VMs that our Crate cluster will be added to. Click on the _Infrastructure -> Clusters_ menu and then the 'Create Cluster' button in the top right of the dashboard screen. Select your hosting provider and the appropriate configuration options for region, authentication and memory/cpu.

ContainerShip uses the concept of 'Leaders' and 'Followers', that handle management of containers and applications and the actual containers and applications respectively. Read more about these concepts in [ContainerShip's documentation](https://docs.containership.io/v0.2.4/docs/terminology).

## Create Application
After a few minutes waiting for the cluster to come online, we can create our Application, the Crate cluster. Open your cluster admin page and scroll down to the green 'New Application' button. As ContainerShip have made Crate available in their marketplace, click the 'From Marketplace' button and click 'Add to Cluster' underneath Crate from the following screen.

Choose the cluster you wish to install Crate in and set its memory and CPU options. You should now see Crate listed underneath the 'Applications' section, it will be set up on the follower Hosts, so two nodes. Copy one of the Follower Host IP addresses, and open it in a browser with _:4200/admin_ appended and you will see the Crate admin UI.

## Scaling
There are two methods for scaling your cluster with ContainerShip, the number of containers per VM, or the number of VMs.

To increase the number of VMs, simply click the 'Scale' button in the 'Follower Hosts' section on the _Cluster_ page and increase the number of hosts.

To increase the number of containers per VM, open _Infrastructure -> Applications_, click on _Crate_ and change the 'constraints.per_host' tag by removing and re-adding it. This will cause an automatic redistribution of VMs and containers.

## Conclusion
This is a simple 'getting started' guide to getting Crate running on ContainerShip and we suggest you read their [documentation](https://docs.containership.io/) to get a further idea on what options are available such as using environment variables, a command line interface, tags available and much more.
