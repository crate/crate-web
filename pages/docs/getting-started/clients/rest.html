title: Connecting to Crate with REST
author: Chris Ward

You can connect to the Crate HTTP endpoint with any standard tool, such as [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) or [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie), we will be using curl.

## Connect to Crate
The endpoint expects a SQL statement sent as a value associated with the key `stmt`, i.e.

```bash
curl -sSXPOST 'CLUSTER_IP:4200/_sql?pretty' -d '{"stmt":"select name from sys.cluster"}'
```

Will connect to a cluster and return basic information about the cluster.
