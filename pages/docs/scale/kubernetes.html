description: Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications - like Crate. Use Kubernetes to deploy your Crate cluster.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications that builds on 15 years of experience running production workflows at Google.

Thanks to [our Docker image](/docs/install/containers/docker), managing your Crate cluster with Kubernetes requires only a few steps.

This guide will assume that you already have [kubectl](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/) and a [Kubernetes cluster](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/binary_release/) ready to go. All of the commands/templates/etc. provided should be customized to meet your personal requirements!

## The Crate Template

At Crate we are proud of our community and our user ['cedboss'](https://github.com/cedbossneo) provided us with a template to use for Kubernetes to deploy Crate. Building on that draft we developed a more mature version:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: crate-discovery
  labels:
    app: crate
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 4200
    name: crate-web
  - port: 4300
    name: cluster
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: crate
---
apiVersion: "apps/v1alpha1"
kind: PetSet
metadata:
  name: crate
spec:
  serviceName: "crate-db"
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: crate
      annotations:
        pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/initialized: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: crate
        image: crate:latest
        command:
          - /docker-entrypoint.sh
          - -Des.cluster.name=${CLUSTER_NAME}
          - -Des.multicast.enabled=false
          - -Des.discovery.type=srv
          - -Des.discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes=2
          - -Des.gateway.recover_after_nodes=2
          - -Des.gateway.expected_nodes=${EXPECTED_NODES}
          - -Des.discovery.srv.query=_cluster._tcp.crate-discovery.default.svc.cluster.local
        volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /data
              name: data
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 2Gi
        ports:
        - containerPort: 4200
          name: db
        - containerPort: 4300
          name: cluster
        env:
        # Half the available memory.
        - name: CRATE_HEAP_SIZE
          value: "1g"
        - name: EXPECTED_NODES
          value: "3"
        - name: CLUSTER_NAME
          value: "my-crate-cluster"
      volumes:
        - name: data
          hostPath:
            emptyDir:
              medium: "Memory"

```

### Start Crate

This template utilizes [Kubernetes 1.3's PetSet][1] type that allows to add SRV records for DNS discovery and a proper shutdown when scaling. While Crate would also work as a stateless pod (cattle), this way facilitates a couple of things like storage and shard migration on zero downtime upgrades. To create a cluster based on that template use:

```bash
kubectl create -f crate-kubernetes.yml
```

Find out the public IP and the services that have been created with

```bash
kubectl get services
```

### Scale Crate

Next you can scale your cluster by editing the PetSet's configuration and setting the 'replicas' field to the desired number of pods. Be aware that currently this is the only mutable value:

```bash
kubectl edit petset crate
```
After increasing/decreasing the number of replicas (pod replicas), Crate's config should be adjusted (especially when scaling down or your cluster might disappear!) and there are three important settings in this context:

```
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes=2
gateway.recover_after_nodes=2
gateway.expected_nodes=3
```
The settings `recover_after_nodes` and `expected_nodes` are important for the cluster to know the intended size and if it should recover or rather accept the provided cluster state *on startup*. Therefore changing these values will require a cluster restart and a misconfiguration will trigger a cluster check to fail. However, the cluster will still continue to function properly. `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` on the other hand influences how the master nodes are elected, and a value greater than the number of nodes is going to disband the cluster, whereas a too small number might lead to a split-brain scenario - which is why it is necessary to adjust this number when scaling by issuing

```sql
SET GLOBAL PERSISTENT discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes = 5
```
... where 5 is one more than half the actual number of nodes in the cluster.
Now to monitor the available pods you can use `kubectl proxy` which starts a web server with log outputs and a list of the available pods.


### Customize Crate

In this template, Crate is configured using the `-D` parameters for the executable. Every setting in [Crate's YAML config](https://crate.io/docs/reference/configuration.html) is available there and allows for a better flexibility than passing around config files.

### Storage

Many container hosting services offer spinning disks as default storage media, which - for Crate - is often too slow. In addition to that, replication only makes sense if the data is on separate physical media in order to achieve high availability and to avoid potential bottlenecks when several clusters attach the same storage. Since the [Persistent Volume Claims](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/examples/experimental/persistent-volume-provisioning/README.md) depend on the Kubernetes cluster (and if it runs in the cloud), the volume template is currently not included in our template. You can familiarize yourself with them [here][1]. For now, the volumes are explicitly stated and to customize that accordingly, the [volume guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/volumes/) is very helpful.

## Manual Approach

Create a Kubernetes 'pod', or a group of containers tied together for administration and networking. In this case, using the Crate Docker image and exposing the ports that Crate uses.

```bash
kubectl run crate-cluster --image=crate:latest --port=4200 --port=4300
```

Expose the pod to the outside World with a specific Kubernetes service:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment crate-cluster --type="LoadBalancer"
```

And use the following command to get the status of the service you just created:

```bash
kubectl get services crate-cluster
```

Scale a Crate pod with:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment crate-cluster --replicas=3
```
