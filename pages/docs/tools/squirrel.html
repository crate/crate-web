title: Using Crate with SQuirreL SQL
author: Christian Haudum


**[SQuirreL](http://www.squirrelsql.org/)** is a graphical SQL client application that can be used to browse and query a JDBC compliant database.

As Crate supports JDBC with its Crate JDBC driver, it can easily be used with SQUirreL.

## Setup
[SQuirreL](http://www.squirrelsql.org/) does not provide a Crate driver with its distribution, so an extra setup step is required to run Crate with [SQuirreL](http://www.squirrelsql.org/):

1. Copy the [Crate JDBC standalone](https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view/files/io/crate/crate-jdbc-standalone) jar to the SQuirreL lib folder. On OS X, when installing SQuirreL with the MaxOS X installer, this is `/Applications/SQuirreLSQL.app/Contents/Resources/Java/lib/`

2. Start [SQuirreL]((http://www.squirrelsql.org/).

3. Choose the `Drivers` tab and add a new driver, adding the following information into the form and confirm by pressing ok.  
![squirrel add driver dialogue]({% media '/media/1602/squirrel_add_driver.png' %})

4. Choose the `Aliases` tab and add a new Alias, Choose your new driver (called crate in our example) and enter your database URL. Username and password are not supported, so leave them blank.  
![squirrel add alias dialogue]({% media '/media/1602/squirrel_add_alias.png' %})

5. Connect your alias to your crate instance.

## Usage

You can browse Crate using the Object Tree Worksheet, that is the usual view you use for browsing your tables and get information about their schema.

![browsing the content and schema of a table using squirrel]({% media '/media/1602/squirrel_view.png' %})

When browsing a table’s content using Content, it is possible to edit the table contents by right-clicking and choosing Make Editable.

![editing the content of a table using squirrel]({% media '/media/1602/squirrel_edit.png' %})

Using the SQuirreL SQL Editor it is possible to execute arbitrary SQL commands and scripts.
