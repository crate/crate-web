description: Management tools, utilities and data visualization for Crate
author: Christian Haudum

There are several tools that play well with Crate, from development utilities to data visualization tools. We even use some of them ourselves!

This page gives an overview of the tools available and tested with the latest version of Crate. If you know of any other tools that work well with Crate, please [get in touch](mailto:info@crate.io).

## Management Utilities

### SQuirreL SQL

SQirreL is an open-source, cross-platform, graphical Java SQL Client (requires Java >= 6.x) that allows you to view the structure of any JDBC compliant database.
