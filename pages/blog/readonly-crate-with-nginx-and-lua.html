_tl;dr ... There's a [gist](https://gist.github.com/chaudum/39373c14cf7f89e0c808) of the Nginx configuration._

At the moment, Crate does not have a builtin concept of ACL or user permissions, but there are several ways to secure a cluster and prevent it from unauthorized access. However, sometimes you want make your cluster just read-only and people have been asking us about that.

This post will show you how to achieve this with a few simple steps using Nginx and a few lines of Lua code.

Installing the [HttpLuaModule](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule) for Nginx can be tricky, so we use [OpenResty](http://openresty.org/), a web application server that bundles Nginx's core and lots of 3rd-party Nginx modules.  
No matter whether you're using Nginx+HttpLuaModule or Openresty, I will just refer to it as Nginx for now.

Once you successfully set up Nginx, we can take a look at the configuration. Let's create a new `.conf` file that is included by the main `nginx.conf` on your host, and call it `crate-readonly.conf`.

### The `upstream` Directive

First, we need to define the upstream servers. Since Crate is using the HTTP protocol we can simply use the private IPs of the Crate instances and their exposed HTTP ports (`4200` if not otherwise specified).

Assuming our Crate cluster is already set up and consists of 3 nodes that are available on `10.0.0.{100..103}:4200`, the upstream directive looks like this:

```nginx
upstream crate {
    server 10.0.0.101:4200;
    server 10.0.0.102:4200;
    server 10.0.0.103:4200;
}
```

The default load balancing method is round-robin, where requests to the upstream servers are distributed in a basic round-robin fashion. There are also other methods that are described [here](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html), from which the `least_conn` method could be a good option:

> Least-connected allows controlling the load on application instances more fairly in a situation when some of the requests take longer to complete.

```nginx
upstream crate {
    least_conn;
    server 10.0.0.101:4200;
    server 10.0.0.102:4200;
    server 10.0.0.103:4200;
}
```

### The `server` Directive

Crate provides a HTTP Endpoint that can be used to submit SQL queries. The endpoint is accessible on `/_sql` ([see documentation](https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/rest.html)).

Therefore we can define a location directive `/_sql` that passes the requests to the crate upstreams defined above. The most basic configuration would look like:

```nginx
server {
    listen 4220;
    location = /_sql {
        # define upstream
        proxy_pass http://crate;
    }
}
```

However, this does not yet limit any functionality, but only exposes ALL functionality via the Nginx proxy.

Even before restricting access we'll need to add some more options to the server configuration:

**Permit only POST requests**

Restricting requests is mainly a sanity check upfront, so invalid requests that are not POST requests are handled upfront.

```nginx
if ($request_method !~ ^(POST)$ ) {
    return 403;
}
```

**Add additional headers to proxy request**

Setting the `Accept` header for proxy requests also minimizes the risk of invalid requests.

```nginx
proxy_set_header Accept "*/json";
```

**Set the timeout for proxy requests**

Queries and especially the `COPY FROM` statement can take quite a long time to execute. The timeout really depends on the usecase, and whether you want to return without a response. Note that even if the proxy request times out, the execution of the statement in Crate does **not** abort! That's why we want set the timeout quite high.

```nginx
proxy_read_timeout 60s;
```

**Improve the error handling**

By default, Nginx retries a request on another upstream server if the first one times out. That is something we do not want to happen, so we have to define under which circumstances Nginx should retry on another upstream.

```nginx
proxy_next_upstream error invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503;
```

**Server directive, but still without restrictions**

```nginx
server {
    listen 4220;

    location = /_sql {
        # only permit POST requests
        if ($request_method !~ ^(POST)$ ) {
            return 403;
        }
        
        # set proxy headers
        proxy_set_header Accept "*/json";

        # set upstream timeout
        proxy_read_timeout 60s;

        # conditions in which case to try the next upstream server
        proxy_next_upstream error invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503;

        # define upstream
        proxy_pass http://crate;

    }

}
```

### Access Control With Lua

Now's the time that we need the HttpLuaModule (or OpenResty)!

POST requests to the `/_sql` endpoint contain the SQL statement in the request body, encoded as a JSON string. The [anatomy](https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/rest.html) of the JSON body looks like:

```json
{
  "stmt": "SELECT id, name FROM sys.nodes",
  "args": [],
  "bulk_args": []
}
```

**Simply by checking the `stmt` value for the `SELECT` keyword will allow us to make Crate read-only.**

This check can be achieved by a few lines of Lua code:


```lua
-- load json package
cjson = require "cjson"
-- read POST body
local body = ngx.req.get_body_data()
if body then
  -- decode JSON string into object
  local data = cjson.decode(body)
  -- check lower case stmt value
  if not string.match(string.lower(data.stmt), "^select.*") then
    -- if sql statement does not start with SELECT
    -- return HTTP 403
    ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
  end
else
  -- if no POST date
  -- return HTTP 403
  ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
end
```

This Lua snippet can live directly in the Nginx configuration file.
Either you pass it directly as a string using [`access_by_lua`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule#access_by_lua), or if you prefer to put it into a file, you can use [`access_by_lua_file`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule#access_by_lua_file) and specify the path to the file.

Don't forget to set [`lua_need_request_body`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule#lua_need_request_body) to `on`, otherwise Lua is not able to read the request body!


**Here's the complete `crate-readonly.conf` example:**


```nginx
upstream crate {
    server 10.0.0.101:4200;
    server 10.0.0.102:4200;
    server 10.0.0.103:4200;
}

server {
    listen 4220;

    location = /_sql {
        # only permit POST requests
        if ($request_method !~ ^(POST)$ ) {
            return 403;
        }
        
        # request access to POST body
        lua_need_request_body on;

        # define access using lua
        access_by_lua '
          -- load json package
          cjson = require "cjson"
          -- read POST body
          local body = ngx.req.get_body_data()
          if body then
            -- decode JSON string into object
            local data = cjson.decode(body)
            -- check lower case stmt value
            if not string.match(string.lower(data.stmt), "^select.*") then
              -- if sql statement does not start with SELECT
              -- return HTTP 403
              ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
            end
          else
            -- if no POST date
            -- return HTTP 403
            ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_FORBIDDEN)
          end
        ';

        # set proxy headers
        proxy_set_header User-Agent $http_user_agent;
        proxy_set_header Accept "*/json";

        # set upstream timeout
        # complex queries may take some time
        proxy_read_timeout 60s;

        # conditions in which case to try the next upstream server
        # note: on timeout you must not try another upstream,
        #       otherwise you'd invoke a statement several times
        proxy_next_upstream error invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503;

        # define upstream
        proxy_pass http://crate;

    }

}
```

### Testing The Read-Only Cluster

After restarting Nginx, we are able to test what we've done!

**SELECT statement is allowed**

```sh
> curl -i 127.0.0.1:4220/_sql -d '{"stmt": "SELECT * FROM sys.nodes"}'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: ngx_openresty/1.4.3.6
Date: Wed, 04 Feb 2015 22:28:56 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 2734
Connection: keep-alive
...
```

**CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE are not permitted**

```sh
> curl -i 127.0.0.1:4220/_sql -d '{"stmt": "CREATE TABLE foo (name STRING)"}'
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Server: ngx_openresty/1.4.3.6
Date: Wed, 04 Feb 2015 22:29:42 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 178
Connection: keep-alive
...
```

**Works!**

### Additional Notes

Additional to the steps above, you need to prevent every single node from being exposed to the public.

Also, you probably want to restrict access to the proxy by adding `allow` and `deny` to the server directive, for example:

```nginx
server {
    ...
    allow 127.0.0.1;
    deny all;
    ...
}
```
