Meet Mathias Fußenegger, aka 'Jordi', one of Crate's core engineers and a massive Linux fan.

At Snow Sprint, amongst other things, Jordi decided to add a random data generator to his Crate dev tools project.


## Introducing Cr8 - Crate Dev Tools

### Installing
You will need at least Python 3.4, Install with pip.

```bash
pip install cr8
```

### Usage
Cr8 has five tools available, which can be found by typing `cr8 -h` or `cr8 <subcommand> -h`. These are summarized below.

#### SQL Statement Runtime
Measure the runtime of a specific SQL statement on a cluster:

```bash
cr8 timeit "select * from tweets limit 100" SERVER_IP:4200
```

#### Generate an Insert Statement from JSON
To generate an insert statement from a supplied JSON string, ready for use on a Crate cluster:

```bash
echo '{"name": "Arthur", "lastname": "Dent"}' | cr8 json2insert mytable
```

Which will generate:

```bash
insert into mytable (lastname, name) values (?, ?)
['Dent', 'Arthur']
```

#### Upload a File into a BLOB table
To upload a file from your local file system to a Crate cluster BLOB table:

```bash
cr8 upload SERVER_IP:4200 blobtable /tmp/screenshot.png
```

#### Fill a Table with Random Data
To fill a table with randomly generated data from [faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker):

```bash
cr8 fill-table SERVER_IP:4200 mytable 100000
```

In this example, the `100000` is the amount of records you wish to fill. The script will read the table schema and map these to providers from faker.
