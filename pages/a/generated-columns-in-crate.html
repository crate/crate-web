Crate are pleased to announce the support of generated columns. The new functionality will be available from the fresh **0.54.0** testing release!

The idea behind generated columns is to have its values computed from **generation expressions** provided at the time of definition, unlike regular columns, where values are set explicitly. For those of you interested, generated columns in Crate implements Feature T175 from the ANSI SQL:2006 standard.

Defining expressions is flexible. It's possible to create complex expressions, reference values of other columns and providing a data type for columns is optional and can be inferred by the return type of the supplied expression, but the values must be equal.

## Use cases

Generated columns provide an effortless way to solve a variety of problems, let's take a closer look:

### Partition by expression

Imagine that you have to analyze time-based data, e.g. a log with a few hundred millions of records, where only ones in particular time slices have a value. During analyzing you might have ``group by`` queries which are too slow on your current setup if you query the whole data set.

You need a smart solution to improve the query speed. One way to achieve this is to look up data in the sliced samples which contain the records of interest, instead of iterating over all existing records. That is where [partitioned tables](https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/partitioned_tables.html) come to the rescue. This functionality lets you have separate partitions but still query them like a single table.

For our log data and analyzing queries use case, the most suitable method would be to partition the table by a column containing a timestamp. But what if the column in the [partitioned by](https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/reference/create_table.html#partitioned-by-clause) clause has low granularity or does not suit our queries well enough. In both cases we would end up either with too many partitions in the table or find ourselves performing additional work to adopt the queries.

With **generated columns** the challenge can be simply addressed. Let's create an example of analyzing data logs on a monthly basis, while having day granularity for the timestamped column.

First, create a `log` table with the new generated column `month` and put it into [partitioned by](https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/reference/create_table.html#partitioned-by-clause) clause

```bash
cr> create table logs(
      log string,
      created timestamp,
      month as date_trunc('month', created)
    ) partitioned by (month);
CREATE OK (... sec)
```

In the next step, we insert log records into the table.

```bash
cr> insert into logs (log, created) values
      ('log_2015_01_01', '2015-01-01'),
      ('log_2015-01_02', '2015-01-02'),
      ('log_2015_02_01', '2015-02-01'),
      ('log_2015_02_02', '2015-02-02'),
      ('log_2015_03_01', '2015-03-01');
INSERT OK, 5 row affected (... sec)
```

We can see the table has been partitioned by the generated `month` column.

```bash
cr> select table_name, partition_ident, 'values'
      from information_schema.table_partitions
      WHERE table_name = 'logs';
+------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| table_name | partition_ident          | values                   |
+------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| log        | 04732d1i6kojce1g60o30c1g | {'month': 1425168000000} |
| log        | 04732d1i60o3ec1k60o30c1g | {'month': 1420070400000} |
| log        | 04732d1i68rj8e1o60o30c1g | {'month': 1422748800000} |
+------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
SELECT 3 rows in set (... sec)
```

Looks good! Now we can analyze the log data on a monthly basis and utilize all the benefits of having a partitioned table. As you can see the combination of [partitioned tables](https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/partitioned_tables.html) and [generated columns](https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/generated-columns.html) provides a great tool in the Crate toolkit.

### Query optimization on generated column partitions

The implementation of **generated columns** for the [partitioned by](https://crate.io/docs/en/latest/sql/reference/create_table.html#partitioned-by-clause) clause has been optimized for special cases.

#### Selection on **generated columns** uses current optimization

**Generated columns** utilize the same optimization implemented for regular columns in a `partitioned by` clause. Thus filtering log records on the generated column `month`, which is part of the `partitioned by` clause, would result in effecting only the specific partition. This behavior is expected from regular columns under the same circumstances.

```bash
cr> select log,
      date_format('%Y-%m-%d', created) as created,
      date_format('%Y-%m-%d', month) as month
      from logs
      where month = '2015-01';
+----------------+------------+---------+
| log            | created    | month   |
+----------------+------------+---------+
| log_2015_01_01 | 2015-01-01 | 2015-01 |
| log_2015-01_02 | 2015-01-02 | 2015-01 |
+----------------+------------+---------+
SELECT 2 rows in set (... sec)
```

The execution of the given query only affects the `2015-01` partition.

#### Selection on a column which is part of a generated column/Query rewrite

The `created` column is used for generating the `month` column on which the table is partitioned. The optimization added allows querying the column used in the **generation expression** of the generated column and still hit only the partition where this value belongs. For example:

```bash
cr> select log,
      date_format('%Y-%m-%d', created) as created,
      date_format('%Y-%m', month) as month
      from logs
      where created = '2015-02-01';
+----------------+------------+---------+
| log            | created    | month   |
+----------------+------------+---------+
| log_2015_02_01 | 2015-02-01 | 2015-02 |
+----------------+------------+---------+
SELECT 1 row in set (... sec)
```

The only partition affected by this query is `2015-02`.

### Calculated columns

**Generated columns** are computed internally upon [INSERT](https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/dml.html#inserting-data) and [UPDATE](https://crate.io/docs/stable/sql/dml.html#updating-data). A great application of **generated columns** is the computation of the columns values on the fly.

Continuing our demonstration, we will create a table with cities and their current temperature measured in celsius. It would be great to get the temperature also in fahrenheit and kelvin, without having any computation on the application layer or once records are inserted or updated.

This can be accomplished by defining two **generated columns**, kelvin and fahrenheit, and providing them with the **generation expressions** needed for the conversions.

```bash
cr> create table weather (
      city string,
      celsius double,
      kelvin as (celsius + 273.15),
      fahrenheit as (celsius * 9/5 + 32)
    );
CREATE OK (... sec)
```

#### On insert calculation

First, let's populate the `weather` table with a few records.

```bash
cr> insert into weather (city, celsius) values
      ('Dornbirn', 9),
      ('Berlin', 7),
      ('London', 14),
      ('San Francisco', 8);
INSERT OK, 2 row affected (... sec)
```

After executing the insert query we select all columns of the new `weather` table.

```bash
cr> select city, celsius, kelvin, fahrenheit from weather;
+---------------+---------+--------+------------+
| city          | celsius | kelvin | fahrenheit |
+---------------+---------+--------+------------+
| Berlin        |     7.0 | 280.15 |       44.6 |
| San Francisco |     8.0 | 281.15 |       46.4 |
| London        |    14.0 | 287.15 |       57.2 |
| Dornbirn      |     9.0 | 282.15 |       48.2 |
+---------------+---------+--------+------------+
SELECT 4 rows in set (... sec)
```

Looking at the `kelvin` and `fahrenheit` columns we can see that the values of the **generated columns** have been computed on the fly by the **generation expressions**.

#### On update calculation

The weather has changed and so the `weather` table needs to be updated.

```bash
cr> update weather set celsius = -1
      where city = 'Dornbirn';
UPDATE OK, 1 row affected (... sec)
```

After applying the update, query the `weather` table for all columns again.

```bash
cr> select city, celsius, kelvin, fahrenheit
      from weather;
+---------------+---------+--------+------------+
| city          | celsius | kelvin | fahrenheit |
+---------------+---------+--------+------------+
| Berlin        |     7.0 | 280.15 |       44.6 |
| San Francisco |     8.0 | 281.15 |       46.4 |
| London        |    14.0 | 287.15 |       57.2 |
| Dornbirn      |    -1.0 | 252.15 |       30.2 |
+---------------+---------+--------+------------+
SELECT 4 rows in set (... sec)
```

As expected, the newly calculated values of `kelvin` and `fahrenheit` are shown in the query output where the name of the city is **Dornbirn**.
