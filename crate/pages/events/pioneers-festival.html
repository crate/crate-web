## What is Pioneers all about?

Pioneers is all about pioneers.

**WHAT’S A PIONEER YOU ASK?**

Fair enough. For us a pioneer is somebody who

* pushes the borders of what is possible
* has a vision for our future
* and most important of all someone who uses the power of technology, science and entrepreneurship to improve our daily lives. Learn about our pioneer work: Crate, a super simple backend for data-intensive applications, offers a solution for the future of data management.
