Crate is exhibiting and speaking at Oscon this year.
On July 22, Join Christian Lutz and Mathias Fussenegger to hear about a
Real Time backend for the Internet of Things, or come to our booth and have
a chat with us. We’ll be there to show how simple and easy it is to make our
massively scalable data store work.
