**“3 years after studiVZ ... challenges, problems and how to solve them with today’s technologies”**
at the International PHP Conference in Munich.

Sebastian Utz was one of the Software Architects at studiVZ and responsible
for the scaling of the platform. Basti, who delivered up to 70 percent of the
platform features, needed massive workarounds and tweaks to withstand the load
of approximately 17 millions of active users. Listen to Sebastian on the
28th of October when he talks about the impact of todays technologies and
how he managed to overcome such issues.
