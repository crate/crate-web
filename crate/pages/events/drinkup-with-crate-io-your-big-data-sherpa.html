Join us in a beautiful rooftop lounge setting for drinks and snacks,
just a few blocks from the Strata Conference.

Come discuss Crate.IO’s unique elastic data store with founder and
EO Jodok Batlogg and the Crate.IO team. We’ll talk about what we’re solving
and why, as well as how we’ve approached the problem. We’ll be looking to
discuss your use cases, get feedback and suggestions. If your startup or business
is looking to try Crate, we have Google Cloud Platform resources to give away!

## Where & When?

Come to the beautiful [Hudson Terrace](https://goo.gl/maps/r9JAO),
a short walk from the convention center anytime between 6 and 8:00pm on Thursday.
The address is **621 West 46th, between 11th & 12th Avenues**,

## What is Crate?

Crate is a new breed of database to serve today’s mammoth data needs. Based on the familiar SQL syntax, Crate combines high availability, resiliency, and scalability in a distributed design that allows you to query mountains of data in realtime, not batches. A shared-nothing, fully searchable, document- oriented clustered data store, it’s the perfect highly available backend for your web scale services. Semi-structured data alongside binary objects, all accessible via SQL.
