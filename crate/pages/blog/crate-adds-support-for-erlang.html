CrateIO is really happy to announce that we've released the first version of our [Erlang driver](https://github.com/crate/craterl) for Crate!

It's important for us here at Crate to [support our developers](/community/), and with the release of "Craterl", now we can support a wider developer base. Craterl brings full SQL support including parameters and bulk operations, full BLOB support, for `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and `HEAD` requests.

Star us on GitHub or join our [Google Group](http://cr8.is/12q7yRB) if you'd like to keep up to date on this component, or Crate in general.
