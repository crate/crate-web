      <p class="lead">Crate is ideal for containerized environments such as <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>.
        You can get your own cluster running within minutes. Easy as cake!</p>

      <p>We host the Docker images for Crate on Docker&#8217;s own
        <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/crate/">Docker Hub Registry</a>.
        After <a href="http://docs.docker.com">installing Docker</a> you can pull the latest image:</p>
      <pre class="codehighlight"><span class="nd">docker</span> <span class="ni">pull</span> <span class="ni">crate</span></pre>
      <p>To pull an image with a certain Crate version you can do:</p>
      <pre class="codehighlight"><span class="nd">docker</span> <span class="ni">pull</span> <span class="ni">crate:X.Y.Z</span></pre>
      <p>where <code>X.Y.Z</code> is the version number of Crate. Alternatively you can use `latest` to get the latest stable version.</p>
      <p>There are Docker images available from version <code>0.41.4</code>.
        For further information please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/crate/docker-crate/">docker-crate</a> Github repository.</p>

            <h3>Attach persistent data directory</h3>

            <h3>Use custom Crate configuration</h3>
            <pre class="codehighlight"><span class="nd">docker</span> <span class="ni">run</span> <span class="o">-d</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4200:4200</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4300:4300</span> <span class="ni">crate</span> <span class="m">crate</span> <span class="o">-D</span><span class="m">es.config=/path/to/crate.yml</span></pre>

            <p>Any configuration settings may be specified upon startup using the <code>-D</code> option prefix. For example, configuring the cluster name by using system properties will work this way:</p>

            <pre class="codehighlight"><span class="nd">docker</span> <span class="ni">run</span> <span class="o">-d</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4200:4200</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4300:4300</span> <span class="ni">crate</span> <span class="m">crate</span> <span class="o">-D</span><span class="m">es.cluster.name=cluster</span></pre>

            <p>For further configuration options please refer to the
                <a href="/docs/stable/configuration.html">Configuration</a> section of the online documentation.</p>

            <h3>Environment</h3>
            <p>To set environment variables for Crate Data you need to use the <code>--env</code> option when starting the docker image.</p>

            <p>For example, setting the heap size:</p>

            <pre class="codehighlight"><span class="nd">docker</span> <span class="ni">run</span> <span class="o">-d</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4200:4200</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4300:4300</span> <span class="o">--env</span> <span class="m">CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=32g</span> <span class="ni">crate</span></pre>

            <h2>Multicast</h2>
            <p>Crate uses multicast for node discovery by default. However, Docker only supports multicast on the same host. This means that nodes that are started on the same host will discover each other automatically, but nodes that are started on different hosts need unicast enabled.</p>

            <p>You can enable unicast in your custom <code>crate.yml</code>.
                See also: <a href="{% url '/blog/using-crate-in-multinode-setup.html' %}">Using Crate Data in a Multi Node Setup</a>.</p>

            <p>Due to its architecture, Crate publishes the host it runs on for discovery within the cluster. Since the address of the host inside the docker container differs from the actual host the docker image is running on, you need to tell Crate to publish the address of the docker host for discovery.</p>

            <pre class="codehighlight"><span class="nd">docker</span> <span class="ni">run</span> <span class="o">-d</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4200:4200</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4300:4300</span> <span class="ni">crate</span> <span class="m">crate</span> <span class="o">-D</span><span class="m">es.network.publish_host=host1.example.com</span></pre>

            <p>If you change the transport port from the default <code>4300</code> to something else, you also need to pass the publish port to Crate.</p>

            <pre class="codehighlight"><span class="nd">docker</span> <span class="ni">run</span> <span class="o">-d</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4200:4200</span> <span class="o">-p</span> <span class="m">4321:4300</span> <span class="ni">crate</span> <span class="m">crate</span> <span class="o">-D</span><span class="m">es.transport.publish_port=4321</span></pre>

            <h2>Installing a Crate cluster using Docker on OSX</h2>

            <p>Getting a Crate cluster running locally on OSX is a little more challenging than it should be because of the fact that Docker requires features of the Linux kernel which OSX does not provide.  Don't worry, we'll walk you through it.  Kudos to the <a href="http://viget.com/extend/how-to-use-docker-on-os-x-the-missing-guide" target="_newbie">Docker on OSX Missing Manual</a> blog post for much of this information.  Please begin this by reading the first section of this post until you get to the "Common Problems" section, which is where we'll take over, otherwise I'm just going to be repeating a lot of directions. The only difference is that after you've run `boot2docker up` you will get three environment variables to export rather than just one.  Be sure to export all three or you'll get errors when trying to run Docker.</p>
            
            <p>Now we'll assume you've gotten Docker and boot2docker installed and running locally.  First thing we'll do is pull down the latest Crate Docker image</p>
            
            <pre class="codehighlight">&gt; docker pull crate:latest</pre>

            <p>Once the pull is complete, we'll need to start the containers.</p>
            
            <pre class="codehighlight">
&gt; docker run -d -P crate
&gt; docker run -d -P crate
&gt; docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 crate

            <p>Here we've started two Crate instances and let Docker bind the Crate ports using the Docker port range (49000-49999), but then we bound the third one to the same port numbers on the boot2docker VM as the container (4200 & 4300). We can't bind all of the containers to the same port on the boot2docker VM because obviously the ports would conflict.  Since Docker is multicast enabled for containers on the same host, the nodes auto-discover each other. Binding only one exposes the cluster at the correct IP address to the boot2docker VM. As you can see below, we can verify the cluster by calling the API on the VM's IP address, using <code>$(boot2docker ip)</code>, on port 4200.</p>
            
            <pre>&gt; curl -XPOST $(boot2docker ip):4200/_sql -d '{ "stmt": "select name from sys.nodes" }'
{"cols":["name"],"duration":218,"rows":[["Shooting Star"],["Crimson"],["Scarlet Spiders"]],"rowcount":3}</pre>            
            
            <p>In this setup, you will always be interfacing with the same node, but this setup is mostly for playing with Crate locally. You can also still connect to the other nodes, they're just not exposed at port 4200. You can see the ports in the <code>`docker ps`</code> output above. In this example, they're 49163 and 49161</p>
            
            <pre>&gt; curl -XPOST $(boot2docker ip):49163/_sql -d '{ "stmt": "select name from sys.nodes" }'
{"cols":["name"],"duration":218,"rows":[["Shooting Star"],["Crimson"],["Scarlet Spiders"]],"rowcount":3}</pre>            
            
            <p>Now you have a 3-node cluster running locally that you can use to develop against Crate or just play around with a cluster.  You can add more nodes simply by instantiating more Docker containers and they'll automatically join the Crate cluster.</p>
