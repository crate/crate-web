[SoftLayer](http://softlayer.com/), IBM's cloud platform, has a slightly different take on "the cloud". They are focusing on high performance (physical) hardware embedded in the best possible infrastructure, because "computing doesn't come out of the sky". However, besides their strong physical hardware that you can choose from, SoftLayer also offers virtual machines with a wide range of configuration possibilities.

This combination makes SoftLayer an ideal hosting provider for your own Crate cluster, no matter if you just need a small cluster to play around or run your production cluster even across data centres.

We at CrateIO have been using [bare metal servers](https://www.softlayer.com/bare-metal-servers) to perform benchmarks on Crate. When using bare metal you have the advantage that you can mix and match hardware. On the other hand the setup/provisioning is more conventional (like on-premise-hosting), since it is not possible to launch/terminate instances in real-time.

A balanced instance configuration for a production Crate host could look similar like that: 

* 8x 2.0GHz cores
* >= 32 GB memory
* >= 100 GB local SSD storage
* 1000 Mbps public/private network interface

We used [SaltStack](http://www.saltstack.com/)'s [Salt Cloud](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/) to launch and provision instances for the test cluster. Salt Cloud provides an abstraction layer for multiple cloud hosting providers, also for [SoftLayer](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/softlayer.html). 

### Server Provisioning With Salt Cloud

Example of `/etc/salt/cloud.profiles`: 

    softlayer:
        provider: crate-softlayer-hw
        domain: crate.io
        image: CENTOS_LATEST #
        location: ams01 # Amsterdam
        cpu_number: 8
        ram: 65536 # 64GB
        disk_size: 100 # GB
        local_disk: True
        max_net_speed: 1000 # 1Gbps
        hourly_billing: False
        private_vlan: {{ VLAN_ID }}
        minion:
            grains:
                role:
                    - crate_softlayer

Example of `/etc/salt/cloud.map`: 

    softlayer:
      - sl1
      - sl2
      - sl3

Launching the instances defined in the cloud.map file is as easy as this command: 

    $ salt-cloud -m /etc/salt/cloud.map -P

And once the instances are running you will be able to provision them by running the `highstate` on the crate_softlayer role that the instances are associated with. 

    $ salt -G 'role:crate_softlayer' state.highstate

The `highstate` is defined in the **sls** (Salt State File). Here's an example of our init.sls: 

    crate_repo:
      pkgrepo.managed:
        - name: crate
        - humanname: Crate
        - baseurl: https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/testing/6/x86_64/
        - enabled: 0 # 1 = testing release.
        - gpgcheck: 1
        - gpgkey: https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
        - required_in:
          - packages

    packages:
      pkg.installed:
        - pkgs:
          - java-1.7.0-openjdk
          - wget
          - crate

    /etc/sysconfig/crate:
      file.managed:
        - user: crate
        - mode: 755
        - contents: |
                    CRATE_MIN_MEM=16g
                    CRATE_MAX_MEM=16g

    /etc/crate/crate.yml:
      file.managed:
        - source: salt://softlayer/crate.yml
        - user: root
        - mode: 644

Example of `crate.yml`:

{% endfilter %}
      <pre><code>name: &lbrace;&lbrace; grains['host'] &rbrace;&rbrace;
cluster:
  name: crate-softlayer
path:
  logs: /path/to/crate/logs
  data: /path/to/crate/data
network:
  tcp:
    connect_timeout: 60s
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 2
discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts:
&lbrace;%- for server, addrs in salt['mine.get']('*', 'network.ip_addrs').items() %&rbrace;
&lbrace;% if server.startswith("sl") %&rbrace;  - &lbrace;&lbrace; addrs[0] &rbrace;&rbrace;:4300&lbrace;% endif -%&rbrace;&lbrace;% endfor %&rbrace;</code></pre>
